Hello, world!

My name is Leonardo Bars Humes and I'm a Master of Science Student at University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP). I'm also currentky studying the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University at Coursera.

I help companys with their demands through data-driven solutions.

As hobbies, I like watch soccer and play guitar (both eletric and acoustic =D).

I hope that my codes can help you somehow.

Greetings from Brazil!
