Hello, World! Léo Humes is here!

I'm a Master of Science Student at University de São Paulo (USP) and a Data Science Specialization Student at Johns Hopkins University.

My aim is develop data-driven solutions that can help companys all around the world to improve its products / services.

As hobbies, I love watch soccer and play guitar (both eletric and acoustic =D).

I hope that my codes can help you somehow.

Greetings from Brazil!
